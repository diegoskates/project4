<p>Why I rebelled?</p>
<p>I rebelled because although superman has a few powers it makes more than any other heros there is.</p>
<p>This is war because any superhero that is DC happens to stronger than Marvel but not as entertaining as Marvel.</p>
<p>We need to be more out there in the world.</p>
<p>Dc makes advertisements about superman of he so strong when all along they could have someone extreme.</p>
<p>Superman gets a new power, Super Flare, istead they can upgrade his original powers.</p>
