<p>Superman Upgrade</p>
<p>Superman should have camouflage and invisibility that way he can beat villains up however he can.</p>
<p>What I planned to happen is for him to get surgery in order to get that.</p>
<p>The powers will come from the heros that have camo and invisibility.</p>
	<center>
<p>This will prove he is a god.</p>
<p>Although superman can beat pretty much every superhero out there Dc Comics should of came up with a better hero than him.</p>
<p>Say you upgrade the powers he has and call him Beyond Superman.</p>
<p>His powers are unlimited to him and can be upgraded until he can be killed.</p>

<p>This will prove he is a god.</p>
